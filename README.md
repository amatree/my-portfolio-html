# Portfolio Website (WIP)

This repository contains my portfolio website, showcasing my skills, projects, and experience. You can preview it here: https://amatree.netlify.app/. 

Recently switched to Netlify in order to utilize their Netlify Forms free api.

## Technologies Used

This project was built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

I also used `fontawesome-free-6.3.0-web` [link here](https://fontawesome.com/versions) to add icon for buttons and other items.

As for fonts, I used `Montserrat` from Google Fonts [link here](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat).

I used https://svgcrop.com/ to crop out white/blank part of a svg image. It worked perfectly with a simple one click!

## Known Issues

* Mobile experience is some what optimized.
